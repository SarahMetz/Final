    <h2>Anime</h2>
    
<p>Anime culture in Japan is a huge part of everyday life and one of the biggest things the country is known for. Almost everyone in Japan has grown up with or sees anime daily. Anime really started becoming popular after World War II, with shows like Astro Boy setting the stage for what anime would become.</p>

<p>Today, anime is everywhere in Japan. You’ll see characters on billboards, vending machines, and even trains. There’s anime for every type of person — from action and romance to comedy and sports — so it connects with a wide range of people. Travel to places like Akihabara in Tokyo, which is full of anime shops, arcades, and themed cafés.</p>

<p>Anime isn’t just entertainment — it’s a major part of Japan’s economy and global image. People from all over the world visit Japan to see spots from their favorite shows or check out the Ghibli Museum. It’s also had a big influence on Japanese fashion, art, and even advertisements.</p>

<p>Overall, anime is a mix of art, storytelling, and culture that represents Japan in a unique way. It’s more than just cartoons — it’s something that connects people around the world through creativity and imagination.</p>

  <h2>Why Is Anime Not Considered A Cartoon?</h2>
  
<p>Anime isn’t considered a cartoon because it’s more than just simple animation — it’s a unique style of storytelling and art that comes from Japan. While both anime and cartoons are animated, they have very different goals and styles. Anime reflects Japanese culture, traditions, and emotions, while cartoons usually come from Western countries and are meant mostly for comedy or kids’ entertainment.</p>

<p>The art style is one of the biggest differences. Anime characters are usually drawn with detailed features, expressive eyes, and colorful settings, while cartoons often have simpler designs and exaggerated movements. Anime also focuses more on storytelling and emotion. Instead of just quick jokes or short adventures, anime often tells deeper stories about love, friendship, loss, or even real-world issues.</p>
