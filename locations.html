    <h2>Touristy Locations</h2>
    
<p>Japan has tons of cool places to visit, mixing modern cities with beautiful historic sites. One of the top places is <strong>Tokyo</strong>, Japan’s busy capital. It’s full of fun things to do — you can see bright lights and giant screens in <strong>Shibuya</strong>, shop in <strong>Shinjuku</strong>, or visit old temples like Senso-ji in Asakusa. Tokyo is also famous for its anime shops, themed cafés, and the <strong>Tokyo Skytree</strong>, which gives you an amazing view of the city.</p>

<p>Another great place to visit is <strong>Kyoto</strong>, known for its traditional side of Japan. You can walk through thousands of red gates at <strong>Fushimi Inari Shrine</strong>, explore the golden <strong>Kinkaku-ji Temple</strong>, or relax in peaceful gardens. Kyoto feels like stepping back in time with its old streets and tea houses.</p>

<p><strong>Osaka</strong> is another favorite city, especially if you love food. It’s known for tasty dishes like takoyaki (octopus balls) and okonomiyaki (savory pancakes). At night, the Dotonbori area lights up with neon signs and tons of street food spots.</p>

<p>If you’re into nature, <strong>Mount Fuji</strong> is beautiful. You can hike around the area or enjoy the views from the nearby <strong>Fuji Five Lakes</strong>. Other cool spots include <strong>Nara</strong>, where friendly deer walk around temples, and <strong>Hokkaido</strong>, famous for skiing and snow festivals.</p>

  <h2>Hidden Gems</h2>
  
<p>Japan isn’t just about Tokyo and Kyoto — it’s full of hidden spots that many tourists miss but are totally worth visiting. One great place is <strong>Kanazawa</strong>, a smaller city known for its old samurai neighborhoods, traditional tea houses, and the beautiful <strong>Kenroku-en Garden</strong>. It’s often called “Little Kyoto” because it has the same classic vibe but without all the crowds.</p>

<p>Another cool destination is <strong>Takayama</strong>, a peaceful mountain town with streets lined with old wooden houses and local markets. It feels like stepping back in time. The Takayama Festival, held twice a year, fills the town with colorful floats and music — it’s one of the most famous local festivals in Japan.</p>

<p>If you’re into nature, <strong>Yakushima Island</strong> is an amazing place to explore. It’s covered in super old forests and is said to have inspired the movie Princess Mononoke. You can hike, see waterfalls, and even spot wild deer and monkeys.</p>

<p>For something artsy, check out <strong>Naoshima</strong>, also known as Japan’s “art island.” It’s full of outdoor art pieces, cool museums, and beautiful beaches — a perfect mix of creativity and calm.</p>

<p>And if you love the ocean, <strong>Ishigaki</strong> in Okinawa is a tropical paradise with crystal-clear water, coral reefs, and awesome snorkeling spots.</p>
