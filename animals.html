    <h2>Sacred Animals Of Japan</h2>
    
    <p>In Japan, some animals are seen as special and have deep meanings in the country’s culture and traditions. For example, deer are believed to be messengers of the gods and can be found freely walking around temples in Nara. Foxes, called kitsune, are thought to protect rice fields and bring good luck. Cranes represent long life and happiness, while turtles stand for wisdom and good fortune. These animals show up a lot in Japanese stories, art, and festivals, showing how much respect people in Japan have for nature and its spiritual side.</p>

  <h2>Cat Island</h2>
  
  <p>Cat Island, or Aoshima, is a small island in Japan known for having way more cats than people. The cats were first brought there to get rid of mice that bothered fishermen, but now they’ve completely taken over the place. Tourists and cat lovers visit from all over to see the dozens of cats walking around freely. Only a few people still live on the island, but visitors and volunteers help take care of the cats, making Aoshima a chill and fun spot where cats are basically in charge.</p>
